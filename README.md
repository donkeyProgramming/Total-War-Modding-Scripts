# Total-War-Modding-Scripts
A collection of python scripts I write for my Total War Modding.

Some of these will be contained in a .blend file, opened in Blender.


## Prefab bmd file to Terry layer file.py

Only tested with Warhammer 3 .bmd,
Input a prefad bmd, it will output an xml file that you can open in Terry


## S2TW_animation_import_export.blend 

For Shogun 2 Total War
Reads/displays animations, does not read/display models!
